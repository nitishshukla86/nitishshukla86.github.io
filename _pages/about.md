  Hi! I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. at MSU working in [iPRoBe](https://iprobe.cse.msu.edu/index.php) lab with [Prof. Arun Ross](https://engineering.msu.edu/faculty/Arun-Ross).
  Before that, I studied M.Sc. Computer Science at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in) and M.Sc. Mathematics at
  [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in). At CMI, I worked with Prof. [KV](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~kv/) and [Madhavan Mukund](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~madhavan/) studying the robustness properties
  of DNNs induced by prototypes. 

  My current research focuses on Facial Biometrics, specifically Morph Attach Detection (MAD) and Facial Demorphing. I am also interested in theoretical computer science, mainly graph theory.
  I'm continually seeking ways to integrate my application and theory interests, providing unique perspectives on deep learning.

  Outside academia, I find joy in cooking ([My Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_the_doctor_chef_?igsh=aG5qeTlic3JrYTcx&utm_source=qr)), watching movies, and playing video games during my free time. Beyond that, I'm an enthusiastic hiker and hold a deep admiration for snowy mountains. If there's anything specific you'd like to discuss or share, feel free to contact me!
